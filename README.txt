[Accesible SFC v2.0]

Developer: Sangbuem Leonard Choo

Folders included:

1. Android - This folder contains only selected files from the Android Studio project.
	     I've only included files that are different from the Eclipse project.
	     
	activity_main.xml
		Takes care of the view. (Kind of like a HTML and CSS)
	MainActivity.java
		The main function (Kind of like a Javascript file)
	bustimer2.apk
		Installable file on Android device

2. Java - This folder contains an Eclipse executable file
	  This can be executed in Eclipse and it will log the results in the console. 

3. iOS (coming soon) - App specially made for the use of Nozawa kun.


This app is continuously being improved even after the school project ended.
